Burto Village[X]

## PrologueOpen1
Fiorian Year 862, the continent of[NL]
Fioria knows relative peace.[ANL]
While no major war has broken out,[NL]
there's plenty of work for mercenaries[NL]
to do.[A][NL]
Ben and Zo's Mercenary Co. arrive at[NL]
Burto Village to take up a job, but little[NL]
do they know, they're in for a[NL]
more hefty task...[A][X]

## PrologueOpen2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAttendant][OpenMidRight][LoadErastus][OpenMidLeft]Master Erastus, sir.[....] I've just[NL]
recieved word from our scouts.[A][OpenMidRight]And?[....] What--[A][CloseEyes][CloseSpeechSlow][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight]*Cough Cough*[....][MoveMidRight][OpenMidRight] *Wheeze*[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveMidLeft][MoveLeft][OpenLeft]Sir, are you--?[A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenEyes]My apologies, I'm fine.[....][NL]
What did they see?[A][OpenLeft][MoveMidLeft][OpenMidLeft]Ill tidings, I'm afraid.[....][NL]
A Sarkrat troupe is coming this way.[ANL]
At their current rate, they'll be[NL]
at the western gates momentarily.[ANL][X]

## PrologueOpen3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuy]Boss says if we git this place,[NL]
we can set up a base to take[A][NL]
care o' dem no good Barbaqs[NL]
for good an' all![....] Hop to it, lads![A][X]

## PrologueOpen4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAttendant][OpenMidRight][LoadErastus][MoveMidRight]Damn[...!] [CloseEyes]Of all times[...][ANL]
[OpenEyes]What of Casimir and Gaignun?[A][OpenMidLeft]We've heard nothing from[NL]
them as of yet I'm afraid.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight]Damn it![....] Were I not in such a sorry state,[NL]
I'd sort that lot out--[A][CloseEyes][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveMidRight][MoveMidRight]*cough cough*[....][MoveMidRight] *cough*[A][OpenMidLeft][MoveRight][OpenRight]My lord, please![....][NL]
You mustn't strain yourself![A][X]

## PrologueOpen5
[OpenRight][LoadBen][OpenFarRight][LoadZo][OpenLeft][LoadMaeFlip]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadTedFlip][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]It seems the bandits beat us here.[A][NL]
We should meet with Erastus,[NL]
and fast![A][NL]
[OpenLeft]Good plan.[NL]
Could you tell who they're with, Ted?[A][NL]
[OpenFarLeft]I think I saw the insignia of the[NL]
Sarkrat's tattooed on one of their arms.[A]
[OpenRight][CloseEyes]Sarkrat's huh?[....] Shouldn't be too bad.[ANL]
[OpenEyes]What do you think, Zo?[NL]
How do we handle this?[ANL]
[OpenFarRight][CloseEyes][ToggleMouthMove]Hmm...[A][X]

## PrologueOpen6
[OpenMidRight][LoadZo]Hex,[....][OpenMidLeft][LoadHexFlip][OpenMidRight][LoadOverworldFaces] try to warn the villagers before[NL]
the bandits ransack their homes.[ANL]
You should get there in no time[NL]
with Ichiban.[A][OpenMidLeft]Understood.[....][NL]
On my way![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Ted,[....][OpenMidLeft][LoadTedFlip][OpenMidRight] you fly around the perimeter[NL]
and take out any enemies[ANL]
trying to interfere with Hex.[ANL]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight]Watch out for the archers,[....][NL]
they'll try to pierce through Mona's wings.[A][OpenMidLeft][LoadTedFlip]You got it![....][NL]
They won't lay a finger on her.[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Mae,[....][OpenLeft][LoadMaeFlip][OpenMidRight] Nate[...][OpenFarLeft][LoadNate][OpenMidRight] You two stick with us and[ANL]
we'll pick off bandits as we[NL]
advance to the magistrate.[A][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][LoadOverworldFaces][OpenMidRight][LoadZo][OpenLeft][LoadMaeFlip][OpenFarLeft][LoadNate][OpenMidRight]It wouldn't do us well to split up,[NL]
we're a little light on armor.[A][OpenLeft]We're on it![A][OpenFarLeft]Leave it to us![A][X]

## PrologueOpen7
[OpenFarRight][LoadBen][OpenRight][LoadZo][OpenFarLeft][LoadNate][OpenLeft][LoadMaeFlip][OpenFarRight]Yeah, that's a good plan.[CloseEyes][ANL]
[ToggleSmile][OpenEyes]Alright everyone, you have your orders![NL]
Let's make our move![A][X]

## Village1
[OpenMidRight][LoadVisitor][OpenMidLeft][LoadVillager1]Thank you for saving me,[NL]
that goon wasn't letting up![ANL]
Here, take this. It isn't much,[NL]
but I hope it helps![A][X]

## Village2
[OpenMidRight][LoadVisitor][OpenMidLeft][LoadVillager2]*Hic*[....] Not this shit again[...] You,[....][MoveMidLeft][NL]
*Hic*[.] kid, this sword is pretty cool, ain it?[ANL]
Kill--[....] U[....]u[....]U[....]rup those bastards with it[NL]

## Village3
[OpenMidRight][LoadVisitor][OpenMidLeft][LoadVillager3]Books contain copious amounts of knowledge.[NL]
[ToggleSmile]This one lets you shoot fire, for example![A][ToggleSmile][NL]
You can use this, right? I can't seem[NL]
to get it to work for myself[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][X]

## BossGeneral
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuy][OpenMidLeft]Who're you?[....][NL]
Some kind of heroes?[ANL]
[ToggleSmile]Well, lemme show you 'ow we[NL]
treat heroes 'round these[....][NL]
parts![A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][X]

## BossBen
[OpenMidRight][LoadBen][ToggleSmile]Well well well, looks like[NL]
our intel was a bit off.[ANL]
[CloseEyes]I thought we were fighting[NL]
the RUTHLESS, INDOMITABLE[ANL]
Sarkrat bandits,[ANL]
[HalfCloseEyes]but you chumps can hardly[NL]
manage a simple invasion![A][ClearFace][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuy]Grrrgh[...!] D'you have any idea[NL]
who you're crossin', brat?![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadBen][CloseEyes]Though, to your credit,[ANL]
attacking while old Erastus[NL]
is bedridden was a smart move.[ANL]
[ToggleSmile][OpenEyes]You clearly didn't account for[NL]
us, though.[A][ClearFace][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuy][MoveMidLeft]Oi![....] I'm talkin to you, punk![ANL]
Who the hell do you[NL]
think you are?![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadBenMad][ToggleSmile]I thought you'd never ask![A][CloseSpeechSlow][MoveMidRight][CloseEyes]You stand before the fearless[NL]
leader of Ben and Zo's[ANL]
Mercenary Company![ANL]
[OpenEyes]Ben Von Arencia, Bringer of[NL]
Chaos![ANL]
[ToggleSmile]And crossing my friends is[NL]
the last mistake you'll ever[NL]
make![A][X]


## BossZo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuy][ToggleSmile]My, my, my,[NL]
what a cute l'il lass.[ANL]
How much gold ya reckon[NL]
I could make off of ya?[ANL]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadZo]Oh, I'm supposed to be[NL]
scared of you, right?[ANL]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadGuy][OpenMidLeft]You little[...!] You fancy yourself[NL]
a court-jester do ye, wench?[A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][NL]
[OpenMidRight][LoadZo][OpenMidRight]The only clown I see[....][HalfCloseEyes][ToggleSmile] is you.[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadGuy][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Grrrrr[...!] That's it![NL]
Taste me axe![....][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][X]

## BossDead
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGuy][OpenMidLeft]What?[....] How?[A][X]

## ZoNotif
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZo][OpenMidLeft]Only one left[...][A][X]

## PrologueEnd1
[OpenRight][LoadBen][OpenFarRight][LoadHex][OpenLeft][LoadMaeFlip][OpenFarLeft][LoadNate][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]And that takes care of that.[NL]
Well done, everyone![ANL]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Yeah, that fight is going to[NL]
leave a mark. Is everyone alright?[ANL]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Yup! All good here![ANL]
Those scum were nothin' me and Nate[NL]
couldn't handle![ANL]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]Oh you're overselling it, Mae.[....][OpenEyes][NL]
Those guys were pretty tough.[ANL]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadZo]
[OpenFarRight][LoadTed]Now that the bandits are out of the[NL]
picture,[ANL]
I believe Erastus agreed to meet us[NL]
in this house?[ANL]
[OpenMidLeft]Yes, hopefully he is safe.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[....][....][....][....][....]Ben?[ANL]
[OpenRight]Don't look at me,[NL]
you made the arrangement.[ANL]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadZoSad][MoveMidLeft][CloseEyes]I-I know![A][OpenEyes][NL]
But just because we've worked with him[NL]
before doesn't mean I know him well.[A][NL]
[OpenRight][CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]Alright, alright, I understand.[NL]
[OpenEyes]Don't worry, [LoadBenMad]I've got this![A][X]

## PrologueEnd2
[OpenLeft][LoadBenMadFlip][CloseEyes][....][....][....][....][....][....][OpenEyes][ToggleSmile]HARK, O' MAGISTRATE OF BURTO![ANL]
THE MIGHTY BEN AND ZO'S[NL]
MERCENARY COMPANY[A][NL]
HAVE EVISCERATED THY FOES![....][NL]
YOU MAY EXIT YOUR ABODE![ANL]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile][LoadZoSad][CloseEyes]You know you could've just[NL]
knocked[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][X]

## PrologueEnd3
[OpenMidRight][LoadErastus][OpenFarLeft][LoadZo][OpenLeft][LoadBenFlip][OpenMidRight]Yes, yes, young heroes,[NL]
fine work, as always.[ANL]
Though, in the future, keep[NL]
in mind I do have neighbors.[ANL]
A simple knock works just fine.[ANL]
[OpenLeft]Ah, of course, sir, my apologies.[ANL]
Now, do you have any idea why those[NL]
brigands keep attacking this village[ANL]
specifically?[ANL]
[OpenMidRight]I do, and it's actually why[NL]
I summoned you.[ANL]
Please, it's cold today.[NL]
Come inside.[A][X]

## PrologueEnd4
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenFarLeft]You have a nice place, sir, but you[NL]
wanted to discuss something with us?[A][NL]
Something tells me it's a little[NL]
more than just the usual.[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]Right you are, young lady.[NL]
Let me start at the beginning.[A][NL]
In this region of Gortala, there are two[NL]
groups of bandits locked in a turf war,[A][NL]
the Sarkrats in the west and the[NL]
Barbaqs in the east.[A][NL]
Based on the positioning of each of their[NL]
respective bases, Burto is the perfect[A][NL]
tactical position for one to launch[NL]
attacks on the other from,[A][NL]
which is why both groups vie to[NL]
occupy it.[A][NL]
[CloseEyes]This is also why our bandit troubles[NL]
frequently persist.[A][OpenEyes][NL]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]So what you're getting at is:[A][NL]
[OpenEyes]you want us to take out both groups so the[NL]
war ends and your village can have peace?[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]Ideally, that would be what I[NL]
ask you, [CloseEyes]but I fear both groups[A][NL]
are far too powerful to be taken out[NL]
separately. I was merely going to requ--[A][NL]
[OpenLeft]It shouldn't be too much[NL]
of an issue for us.[A][NL]
[OpenFarLeft]But who's going to ensure the village's[NL]
safety?[A][NL]
If we set out for one bandit group, the town[NL]
would be defenseless for the other to take.[A][NL]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes][....][....][ToggleSmile][....][....][OpenEyes]Not if we went after both at once![A][NL]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile][OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft]Ben, are you insane?![A][NL]
Our mercenary company is small enough as[NL]
is, if we split up, we won't stand a chance![A][NL]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh come on, Zo![NL]
[HalfCloseEyes]You scared of just a few bandits?[A][OpenEyes][NL]
If they're anything like the ones we fought[NL]
today, we could do it with our eyes closed.[A][NL]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Those were merely a small group[NL]
of what's practically an entire army,[A][NL]
it's not the same thing.[A][NL]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Well naturally, it's not, but that[NL]
doesn't change anything![A][NL]
We're Ben and Zo's Mercenary Co.[NL]
There is no job that we can't handle,[A][NL]
and this is no different. Right, guys?[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x10C]
[OpenRight]If we are to resolve this issue, dispatching[NL]
both groups simultaneously is the only option[A][NL]
we seem to have. You have my vote, Ben.[A][NL]
[OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]Honestly, the hair-brained schemes you[NL]
come up with sometimes[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes][ToggleSmile][NL]
Well, nothing for it. I'm in. Let's do this![A][NL]
[OpenRight][ToggleSmile][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x10B][ToggleSmile]I go where you go,[NL]
and that's all there is to it![A][NL]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile][CloseEyes]Wow[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] You guys[NL]
are way more stupid than I thought.[A][NL]
[OpenEyes]Listen to Zo.[NL]
Do you even hear yourselves?[A][NL]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x109][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Aw c'mon, Hex! You knew[NL]
what you were in for when you joined![A][NL]
What else would you expect from[NL]
our leader?[A][NL]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Need I remind you I'm[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft] ALSO a leader,[A][NL]
and I think this is nothing more than a[NL]
suicide mission.[A][NL]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh come on, don't be like that.[NL]
You saying you don't believe in us?[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]Say we split up, I could lead one squad[NL]
and you the other.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]I figure with my leadership skills and your[NL]
big ol' noggin, we can scrape by somewhow.[A][NL]
[OpenFarLeft][MoveFarLeft][OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]I-it's not that, I just--[....][....][CloseEyes][....][....] Agh, fine.[....][NL]
[OpenEyes]I still don't like it, but clearly I'm in the[A][NL]
minority here. But my point still stands,[NL]
our forces are too thin.[A][NL]
We don't have enough men.[A][NL]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][NL]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x11C]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] if manpower is your problem,[NL]
I may be able to assist.[A][NL]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x10B][ToggleSmile]Wow, old guy! You can fight?[NL]
That's so cool![A][NL]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]Er--[....] [CloseEyes]well yes,[NL]
but that's not what I had in mind.[A][NL]
[OpenEyes]Excuse me, you there, could you go[NL]
fetch Casimir and Gio for me?[A][NL]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x179]At once, sir.[A][NL]

## PrologueEnd5
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenRight]These are our village's[NL]
most stalwart champions.[A][NL]
Would you two care to[NL]
introduce yourselves?[A][NL]
[OpenLeft]I am Casimir. I used to serve in the Gortalan[NL]
military, but in my retirement,[A][NL]
I settled here in Burto and am now[NL]
in service to Lord Erastus.[A][NL]
I am at your command.[NL]
[ToggleSmile]Let us show those bandits what for![A][NL]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile]Hey, I'm Gio. Not as[NL]
much to me as the big guy over there,[A][NL]
but I care about this place and can[NL]
hold my own in a fight.[A][NL]
So if you'd have me, I'd be more[NL]
than happy to join your squad.[A][NL]
[OpenFarRight][CloseEyes]I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove] I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove][OpenEyes]I don't have a problem[NL]
with welcoming you to our little family.[A][NL]
[ToggleSmile]What say you, Zo? You think with these[NL]
two, we stand a chance?[A][NL]
[OpenRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x104][OpenRight][ToggleSmile]Our chances for success have risen[NL]
from zero percent to one percent.[A][NL]
[OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]I think that means you guys are in![A][NL]
[OpenFarLeft]Oh, joy.[A][NL]
[OpenLeft][CloseEyes]I hope to serve admirably.[A][NL]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x10A][OpenMidLeft]If we decide to pursue this idiotic plan,[NL]
we should probably flesh it out a tad.[A][NL]
Think you can make it sound like it[NL]
didn't come out of some village drunk's[A][NL]
mouth, Zo?[A][NL]
[OpenRight]Just give me a second[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
The strongholds are directly east and west[NL]
of this village, right?[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenMidLeft]Yes, that's correct.[A][NL]
The Sarkrats occupy Enchyo Coast to[NL]
the west, and the Barbaqs occupy[A][NL]
the Cronue Caves to the east.[A][NL]
[OpenRight]With that in mind, I'll take the west and Ben[NL]
can take the east.[A][NL]
Cronue Caves are a pretty tight space,[A][NL]
and my fire magic is bound to hurt one[NL]
of the others. Ted can come with me,[A][NL]
since Mona would be too confined to[NL]
fight effectively.[A][NL]
Hex can join Ben's group because the cave[NL]
is at a much greater distance than the[A][NL]
coast, and besides, Ichiban wouldn't do well[NL]
climbing up the steep hills.[A][OpenFarRight]So we've established that Hex and I are[NL]
going east,[A][NL]
and you and Ted are going west.[NL]
What about everyone else?[A][NL]
[OpenRight][CloseEyes]Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x10C][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x10B]I go where you go, bro,[NL]
that's non-negotiable.[A][NL]
[OpenFarLeft]I can't stand caves! It's dark,[NL]
and there're so many creepy-crawlies![A][NL]
Please put me on your team, Zo![A][NL]
[OpenRight][OpenEyes]I suppose that settles you two[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
Casimir,[A][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x10F][OpenRight] if you don't mind heights,[NL]
I'd like to ask you to join our group.[A][NL]
Our defenses are a little lacking.[A][NL]
[OpenLeft]Understood. I am yours to command.[A][NL]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x109][OpenFarLeft]Then I guess we know where Gio is headed.[NL]
[ToggleSmile][HalfCloseEyes]Take care of the pot-head, won't you?[A][NL]
[OpenFarLeft][ToggleSmile][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x10E][OpenFarLeft]You got it.[NL]
[HalfCloseEyes][ToggleSmile]He won't even get a scratch, I swear.[A][NL]
[OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][OpenFarRight][ToggleSmile]Hey! I can take care of myself,[NL]
thank you very much![A][NL]
I appreciate it, though.[NL]
[ToggleSmile]Casimir, take care of Zo, will you?[A][NL]
[OpenLeft]There's no need to worry![NL]
My shield is impregnable![A][NL]
[OpenFarRight]I like your confidence there, man![A][NL]
[CloseEyes]Yeah,[....] this is looking more and more[NL]
feasible by the moment.[A][ToggleSmile][OpenEyes][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x11C][OpenFarRight]
So, to review.[A][NL]
My party consists of Hex, Nate,[NL]
and Gio and we're heading eastward[A][NL]
through this forest to the Cronue[NL]
Caves, where we'll capture the[A][NL]
Barbaq stronghold within, while[NL]
Zo's party will head directly to the[A][NL]
Enchyo Coast and capture the[NL]
Sarkrat base located there.[A][NL]
Does that about cover it?[A][NL]
[OpenRight]Yes, that's about a good summary.[A][NL]
We'll execute our plan first thing in the[NL]
morning, but first, we should get some rest.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]I can have rooms prepared for[NL]
each of you, it's the least I could do[A][NL]
to thank you for your brave deeds today.[A][NL]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x109][ToggleSmile]That would be swell,[NL]
Mona and I could use some shuteye.[A][NL]
Good night, everyone.[A][NL]
[OpenFarRight]Right. Thank you, Erastus sir.[NL]
Good night, everybody.[A][X]

## TheNextMorning
The Next Morning...[X]

## PrologueEnd6
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Oh, man! I slept like a baby![A][NL]
We've got a big day ahead of us.[NL]
You ready, partner?[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Couldn't get much sleep myself, but we[NL]
shouldn't dawdle. Everyone's waiting.[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Alright, let's go.[A][X]

## PrologueEnd7
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x104][OpenLeft]Alright, team.[NL]
The battle ahead won't be an easy one,[A][NL]
but I have faith in each and every[NL]
one of you.[....][ToggleSmile] Let's do this!![A][NL]

## PrologueEndNanalol
[OpenRight][LoadFace][0x102][OpenRight][MoveMidLeft][OpenFarFarRight][LoadFace][0x10D][OpenFarFarRight]Excuse me, you wouldn't[NL]
happen to be Ben and Zo's[A][NL]
Mercenary Co., would you?[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove]Hmm...?[A][ToggleMouthMove][NL]
[OpenFarFarRight][MoveMidRight][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x102][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Why yes, we are, young lady![A][NL]
You wouldn't happen to be a fan[NL]
of ours, would you?[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]Well, you could say that. My name[NL]
is Nana, and I owe a lot to you guys.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh really?[....][NL]
[CloseEyes][ToggleSmile]Well, I'm flattered, thank you very much.[A][NL]
[OpenEyes]Hearing that makes all of our work[NL]
worth it.[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]If you don't mind, I'd like to[NL]
ask you something.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][CloseEyes]If it's within my expansive power,[NL] 
I will certainly make it so![A][NL]
[OpenEyes]Let's hear it![A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[....][ToggleMouthMove]Right.[....] Anyways, today isn't[NL]
your first time in Burto, right?[A][OpenMidLeft]No, it isn't.[A][NL]
We've come to Sir Erastus'[NL]
aid many a time in the past![A][OpenMidRight]So you'll probably remember, their[NL]
last attack was[ToggleMouthMove]...[....] [ToggleMouthMove][CloseEyes]especially brutal.[A][NL]
[OpenEyes]I lost my brother in that raid.[A][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]Oh.[.] I'm[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]sorry to hear that.[A][OpenMidRight]After yesterday's attack, I had enough.[A][NL]
I decided I wasn't going to sit back and[NL]
let them get away with this any longer![A][X]
